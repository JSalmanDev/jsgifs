This website was created to search for gif's using GIPHY's API.

The website I created is a simple page dedicated to searching up to 25 gifs per search.

Technologies I used for this project are HTML,SCSS,CSS,and JS.

Here are the 3 improvements I would make for my site:

Add more styling to my css to make the page pop out more in terms of borders and colors. 
Add and link more pages to the site. 
Dedicate the page to a certain category of gifs and only make those gifs available for the users to search.
